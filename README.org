* Portfolio Tracker
  A simple program to track your portfolio.
  
  This is my attempt to try and create a servive that uses an API. 
  As always feel free to provide feedback. 
 
*** TODO-LIST:
 - Create unit tests with JUnit
 - Optimize the PortfolioSearch controller
 - Redesign both the landing page and the portfolio page!!!
 - Make view handler easy to use to about having to use HashMap if possible
 - Review the code!!!
 - Flesh out README 
 - Write a post
