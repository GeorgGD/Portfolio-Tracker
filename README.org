* Portfolio Tracker
  A simple program to track your portfolio.
  
  This is a personal project to showcase my understanding of working
  with databases. As always feel free to provide feedback. 

** Database design
   For the database itself, I used a drawing tool to draw an 
   ER-diagram of the database with all of its content.

** Recursive descent
  Algorithm used to parse elements (tags in HTML).

** Parser Assumptions
   We asssume that every tag starts with no whitespace, <tag>.
   If the tag starts with whitespace the parser will fail, < tag>.
