* Portfolio Tracker
  A simple program to track your portfolio and for doing papper trading. To run this program just 
  download the repo and run it on a web container such as Tomcat 8, then go to localhost:8080/PortfolioTracker/
  and get your self started!
  
  This is my attempt to try and create a servive that uses an API. 
  As always feel free to provide feedback.
